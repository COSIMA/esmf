This file describes how to create a detailed design document using a set of 
templates.

A design document has the parts shown in the table below.  Brackets [] 
indicate that a part is optional.  In the filenames, "comp" refers to the
component or library that the whole design document describes.   
Components are often broken up into separate "classes" or modules, which 
are typically segregated into separate files.  Several classes or modules
may be included in a single design document.

The structure of the design document accommodates the specification of
multiple language interfaces.  For now, only Fortran and C++ templates are 
actually included.

To create a new design document, fill in the template files.  Use do_newclass
to create new class file templates for each class in your component.  In 
<comp>_desdoc.ctex, be sure to comment out the \input of any files you aren't 
including and specify the \input filenames of files that you are including.

Process protex-instrumented source files for each class or module using ProTeX:

	do_fprotex  <class> <ESMF_class.F90>
	do_chprotex <class> <ESMC_class.h>
	do_ccprotex <class> <ESMC_class.C>
	
	Here ESMF_class.F90, ESMC_class.h, ESMC_class.C are the names of the
        Fortran and C/C++ files, respectively, with the instrumented headers.
        These scripts will produce LaTeX files called <class>_fapi.tex, 
        <class_chapi.tex>, and <class_ccapi.tex>, respectively.

Build a dvi file from LaTeX documents:

	do_latex <comp> des

Produce an html version of the documentation:

	do_l2h <comp> des

The html files are placed in a directory called <comp>_desdoc.

The dvipdf tool can be used to produce a pdf:

	dvipdf <comp>_desdoc.dvi
