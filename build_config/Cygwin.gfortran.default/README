Settings for Cygwin, using the GNU gfortran.

ESMF requires gfortran 4.3 or later.

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER gfortran

Note that if the gfortran-4 and g++-4 packages have been
installed via the cygwin setup installer, the ESMF_F90DEFAULT
and ESMF_CXXDEFAULT compiler names used in build_rules.mk
must be changed accordingly to:

ESMF_F90DEFAULT    = gfortran-4
ESMF_CXXDEFAULT    = g++-4
