Settings for Sun OS, using the SUNWspro Fortran and C compilers.

Note:  We no longer have a working version of ESMF on the Sun
platform.  We ran into compiler problems (internal compiler
errors in trying to compile and/or link the applications)
which we could not solve.

The settings in this file are the last ones which worked.
If anyone gets ESMF running on this platform again, please
let us know.
