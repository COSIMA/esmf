Settings for Darwin (Mac OS X) machines with Intel chips,
using the Intel fortran compiler and either Intel or gcc C compiler.

Requires the following environment settings:

ESMF_COMPILER intel

You can compile the ESMF libraries with either a mix of
ifort and gcc/g++ (the gnu C compilers), or with ifort and icc
(the intel product C/C++ compilers).

To compile with icc, leave ESMF_C_COMPILER unset.
To compile with gcc,  set: ESMF_C_COMPILER gcc

Defaults to 64 bit, can compile on 32-bit systems with:

ESMF_ABI 32


NOTE: This configuration is untested as of now.  The intel
compilers are in beta, and we do not yet have access to one
of the new Mac machines.  If anyone gets this working, please
email to esmf_support@ucar.edu with any changed needed.
