Apparently some versions the AIX xlf 8.x compiler are unable to
handle initializers for derived type contents.  We have set the most
conservative setting possible.  If you want to try to set some of
the initializers but exclude the few which were problematic before,
remove the NO_INITIALIZERS line below and uncomment out the AIX_8_INITBUG
line - which only disables a few of the initializers.  If you want to
try the entire build with initializers, remove both defines and try
to rebuild the framework.   In both cases, the symptom something is
wrong is an incomprehensible "internal compiler" error message during 
the compile of the framework.
