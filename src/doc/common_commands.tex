\newcommand{\apiStatusCompatibleVersion}[1]{This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting at #1. Code which compiles with the #1 and later versions of this interface will also compile with this interface in the current ESMF release.}
\newcommand{\apiStatusModifiedSinceVersion}[1]{This interface was modified since ESMF version #1 was released. Code which compiles with this interface in the current ESMF release is not automatically guaranteed to compile with previous ESMF releases (even #1 and later). If this sort of user code compatibility with the #1 ESMF release is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this interface to features that were available in the #1 release. \\
Changes made after the #1 release:}
