\newcommand{\apiStatusCompatibleVersion}[1]{This interface is backward compatible with ESMF versions starting at #1. If code using this interface compiles with any version of ESMF from #1 up to the current version, then it will compile with the current version.}
\newcommand{\apiStatusModifiedSinceVersion}[1]{This interface was modified since ESMF version #1. The fact that code using this interface compiles with the current ESMF version does not guarantee that it compiles with previous versions of this interface. If user code compatibility with version #1 is desired then care must be taken to limit the use of this interface to features that were available in the #1 release. \\
Changes made after the #1 release:}
