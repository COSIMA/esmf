%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}

\begin{enumerate}

\item {\bf No Transforms.}  Components must exchange data through 
{\tt ESMF\_State} objects.  The input data are available at the time 
the component code is called, and data to be returned to another 
component are available
when that code returns.  {\tt ESMF\_Xform} objects provide a way for
a component to prepare data to be transformed and sent to another 
component from within the execution of the component code.
Transforms are not implemented in this version of the framework.

\item {\bf No automatic unit conversions.}  The ESMF framework does not 
currently contain tools for performing unit conversions, operations that 
are fairly standard within Coupler Components.

\item {\bf No accumulator.}  The ESMF does not have an accumulator tool, to
perform time averaging of fields for coupling.  This is likely to be developed
in the near term.

\end{enumerate}
