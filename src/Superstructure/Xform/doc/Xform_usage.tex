%\subsection{Design}

The Transform class is designed to encapsulate a
series of data transformations needed to couple
data between Components when the Components are 
running concurrently.

It stores the address of a call-back function
which is called from within a Component.  It provides
methods for storing the list of data transformation
functions and arguments needed to accomplish the
proper data manipulations for coupling.

The F90 interfaces use
C++ helper functions are used to perform the actual
call-back function storage and dispatch.
