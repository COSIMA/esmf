%\subsubsection{Restrictions and Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
\item Adding Arrays to an existing ArrayBundle is currently not supported. In
the future this functionality will be provided via the
{\tt ESMF\_ArrayBundleAdd()} method.
\item The current implementation of the ArrayBundle communication methods only
supports ArrayBundles that contain Arrays with identical distribution, i.e.
DistGrid, type, kind and rank.
\item The current implementation of the ArrayBundle communication methods have
not been optimized for performance or memory usage.
\end{itemize}
