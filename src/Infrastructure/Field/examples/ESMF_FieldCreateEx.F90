!\subsubsection{Create Field with Grid and Arrayspec}
!  The user has already created an {\tt ESMF\_Grid} and an
!  {\tt ESMF\_Arrayspec} with data.  This create associates the
!  two objects.  
!EOE
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
!   !
!   !  We first create a Grid with a regular distribution that is
!   !  10x20 DEs.  This version of create simply
!   !  associates the data with the Grid.  The data is referenced
!   !  explicitly on a regular 2x2 uniform grid. 
!   !  Then we create an arrayspec. With grid and arrayspec,
!   !  we then create a field.

!\subsubsection{Create Empty Field}

!  The user creates an empty {\tt ESMF\_Field} object.
!  Then the user can add the Grid and data in later calls
!EOE

!\subsubsection{Reset the ESMF\_Array inside of a ESMF\_Field}
!  It's often necessary to reset the internal data array within a field.
!  The following examples demonstrate different ways of creating {\tt ESMF\_Array}
!  and reset the existing {\tt ESMF\_Array} of a {\tt ESMF\_Field}.

!\subsubsection{Use ESMF\_ArrayCreateFromGrid to reset Field internal Array}
!  User can reset the {\tt ESMF\_Array} inside an existing Field by construct a proper
!  shape {\tt ESMF\_Array} by calling {\tt ESMF\_ArrayCreateFromGrid}.
!EOE
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
!   !
!   !  The user wishes to associate different data with the Field
!   !  created in example 1.  The get data call returns the 
!   !  pointer to the old data array; the set call passes in the 
!   !  pointer to the new array.

    call ESMF_FieldGetArray(field1, array=array1, rc=rc)

    if (rc.NE.ESMF_SUCCESS) finalrc = ESMF_FAILURE

    ! The size of the data in the array still has to line up with the Grid
    ! and its decomposition.

!  User can reset the {\tt ESMF\_Array} inside an existing Field by construct a proper
!  shape {\tt ESMF\_Array}
!EOE
!-------------------------------------------------------------------------
!   !
!   !  The user can substitute another array created by ArrayCreate in field1.
!   ! This example demonstrates some of the topology nature of a field
!   ! default created through FieldCreate which internally calls
!   ! ArrayCreateFromGrid which is done in example 2. This example
!   ! makes it clear that field1's array has a computational region smaller
!   ! than its exclusive region.

!\subsubsection{Destroy a Field}

!  When finished with an {\tt ESMF\_Field}, the destroy method
!  removes it.  However, the objects inside the {\tt ESMF\_Field}
!  that has external reference should be deleted separately, 
!  since objects can be added to
!  more than one {\tt ESMF\_Field}, for example the same {\tt ESMF\_Grid}
!  can be used in multiple {\tt ESMF\_Field}s.
