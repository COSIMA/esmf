%\subsubsection{Restrictions}

% <List class restrictions due to design or implementation strategies.>

The Perf class is restricted to time code segments that are either
purely within a threaded section of the code, or purely within a
non-threaded section of code. There also isn't functionality to
have the same timer nested inside do-loops in a code. When the Perf
class detects that it is timing a section of code that is partially
threaded it will issue warnings to the LogErr file. Another restriction
is that code-sections to be timed, must be named.
