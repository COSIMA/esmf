%\subsection{Design}

The Perf class has five high level interfaces accessible by the user:
PerfCreate, PerfStart, PerfEnd, PerfPrint, and PerfDestroy. PerfCreate does the needed
initialization, allocates needed memory, and sets the monitoring, and doHW 
flags as well as the optional PE-list synchronization. If the monitoring flag is 
set to false by the user performance monitoring 
will be turned off. If the doHW flag is set, it's value will be used as the 
default value to determine if hardware performance monitoring is done. Individual code
segments that are timed can also turn hardware monitoring on or off for
a particular code segment. PerfStart begins timing a code segment, PerfEnd
ends timing a code segment. PerfPrint prints a report on the timing results
for all code segments timed. PerfDestroy then deallocates memory that was
allocated in PerfCreate.

More information on PerfCreate. PerfCreate sets the maximum number of code-segments
that can be used (which will be increased if exceeded) and does the initial
allocates of the array of Segments. If a DE-layout is sent to PerfCreate as a
optional argument, every-time PerfStart is called a synchronization will be done
across all DE's in the DE-Layout given to PerfCreate.

More information on PerfStart. When called PerfStart figures out if the given
code segment has been activated before or not. If it hasn't it increments
the codeSegment counter and begins timing and Hardware monitoring of this
code segment. If the code segment was active before, if it's still active
it triggers an error, since this means a PerfStart has been called more than
once, without a PerfEnd imbetween. If it's not active it activates timing
for this code segment.

More information on PerfEnd. PerfEnd deactivates a code segment, and calls
the SegmentEnd method to accumulate the relevant counters.

More information on PerfPrint. PerfPrint figures out the maximum, minimum, standard-deviation
and average times across both threads and distributed DE's. The results are then 
printed to the Log file. Below we give an example printout for a case with
no threads and no distributed tasks as well as a case with threads and distributed
tasks.

Example 1, printout with no threads and no distributed tasks, and
hardware monitor turned on.
