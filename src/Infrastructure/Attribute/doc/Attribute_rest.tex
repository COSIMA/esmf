Subsequent releases of ESMF will include the concept of an Attribute
hierarchy.  This will enable, for example, the Attributes of the Fields
in a Bundle to be associated with the Bundle.  Future work will also
include the association of a purpose, convention (e.g., CF), and I/O format
(e.g., plain text, XML) with sets of Attributes.
