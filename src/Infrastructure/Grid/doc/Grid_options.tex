 \subsubsection{ESMF\_CoordOrder}

 {\sf DESCRIPTION:\\}
 By default, ESMF assumes coordinates are ordered XYZ, which is also known as
 IJK ordering.  This means that the first coordinate axis (for example, X in
 a cartesian system or latitude in a lat-lon system) is indexed first, the
 second coordinate axis is indexed second, and the third coordinate axis is
 indexed third in all internal arrays.  The Grid class can be set to different
 ordering of coordinates, for example ZXY.  This sets the default coordinate
 ordering for all Fields created from the Grid as well (although there is also
 a way to override this default with a user-specified mapping between rank
 numbers in the Field and Grid during Field creation -- please see the Field
 section for details).  This feature is designed to provide the user with an
 simple mechanism to change the overall ordering of indices.  The
 {ESMF\_CoordOrder} parameter describes ordering options supported by ESMF.

 Valid values are:
 \begin{description}
    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_UNKNOWN]
          Unknown or undefined coordinate ordering.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_XYZ]
          The coordinates are ordered XYZ.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          XY mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_XZY]
          The coordinates are ordered XZY.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          XY mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_YXZ]
          The coordinates are ordered YXZ.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          YX mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_YZX]
          The coordinates are ordered YZX.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          YX mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_ZXY]
          The coordinates are ordered ZXY.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          XY mapping.

    \item [ESMF\_COORD\_ORDER\_ZYX]
          The coordinates are ordered ZYX.  For a 2D Grid, this defaults to
          YX mapping.
