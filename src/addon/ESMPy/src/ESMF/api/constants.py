    Specify which interpolation method to use during regridding.
    Values are:
        BILINEAR = 0
            Bilinear interpolation. Destination value is a linear combination
            of the source values in the cell which contains the destination 
            point. The weights for the linear combination are based on the 
            distance of the destination point from each source value.
        PATCH = 1
            Higher-order patch recovery interpolation. Destination value is a
            weighted average of 2D polynomial patches constructed from cells 
            surrounding the source cell which contains the destination point. 
            This method typically results in better approximations to values 
            and derivatives than bilinear.  However, because of its larger 
            stencil, it also results in a much larger interpolation matrix than 
            the bilinear method.
        CONSERVE = 2
            First order conservative interpolation. Value of a destination cell
            is the weighted sum of the values of the source cells that it 
            overlaps. The weights are determined by the amount the source cell 
            overlaps the destination cell. This method will typically give less 
            accurate approximations to values than the other interpolation 
            methods, however, it will do a much better job preserving the 
            integral of the value between the source and destination. This
            method requires the corner coordinate values to be provided in the 
            Grid, and it currently only works for Fields created on the Grid 
            center stagger (or the Mesh element location).
        NEAREST_STOD = 3
            Nearest neighbor interpolation where each destination
            point is mapped to the closest source point. A given
            source point may go to multiple destination points, but
            no destination point will receive input from more than
            one source point.

            Nearest neighbor interpolation where each destination
            point is mapped to the closest source point. A given
            source point may go to multiple destination points, but no

            bottom of the sphere are now flat, for a big enough
            mismatch between the size of the destination and source
            pole holes, some destination points may still not be able
